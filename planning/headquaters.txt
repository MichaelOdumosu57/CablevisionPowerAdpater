css
    your problem file is probably post-6.css but each site must have its own css giving out this problem
    
    you must apply this universal style to all your element images
to
.elementor-6 .elementor-element.elementor-element-bfd172b .elementor-image img {
    width: 88%;
    filter: brightness( 103% ) contrast( 96% ) saturate( 81% ) blur( 0px ) hue-rotate( 336deg );
    border-radius: 4px 4px 4px 4px;
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 0px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.07);
}

from
    <style>
    .elementor-6 .elementor-element.elementor-element-238cce3 .elementor-image img{
            width: 88%;
            filter: none;
            border-radius: 4px 4px 4px 4px;
            box-shadow: none;
    }
    </style>

testing
    
    unit testing- the single standalone feature works
    integration - when software comes on board they work fine
    regression - new code does not affect existing API



angular

    our end goals are to be able to have the owner modify the site on their own
    I was told its impt to have unit testing so even though stuff should be in services
    
    so our meaningingful components (component + services) should be put together for a while

    first things first get at least 6 css style and focus on being responsive

    use lucidchart to display your goals
